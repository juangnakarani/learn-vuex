> mengenal management state dengan vuex

`Do not think about the application state as something complex and
difficult to understand. In fact, it is no more than just data. Each
component has its own data, and “application state” is data that can be
easily shared between all the components!`, "Olga Filipova"

## Build Setup
``` bash
# init simple webpack
vue init webpack-simple simple-store
# install vuex pada simple webpack
npm install vuex --save
# install dependencies
npm install
# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev
# build for production with minification
npm run build
```
